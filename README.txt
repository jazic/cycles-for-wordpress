Visual feedback and approvals for web development projects. Get organized, insightful feedback from clients and teammates directly on the web page.

== Description ==

**NEW: Control which visitors see Cycles / leave feedback**

**[Cycles](https://cycleshq.com)** allows you to collect visual feedback and approvals on your website.  Share your web pages with clients and colleagues, who view your work in their browser and post feedback directly on your webpages.

See Cycles in action - **[Live Demo](https://demo.cycleshq.com)**

#### Overview
Cycles allows you to:

* **Collect crystal clear client feedback** - With Cycles, your clients comment directly on web pages, so you can see exactly what they’re referencing and understand what they mean. Clients view the website in their browser, and click directly on the page to comment. Feedback remains organized, eliminating back and forth emails and miscommunication.

* **Record approvals/sign off in the browser** - Many clients respond differently when reviewing a website that feels closer to the “finished product.” When you've made any requested changes, your client can approve the page.  Cycles keeps a record of the time, date, and name of the approver in case you need it later.

* **Keep project members informed** - Configure Cycles to send email notifications whenever someone makes a comment or approval.

* **Import feedback into 3rd party services** - Connect your project to Trello, Basecamp, Asana, Slack, Help Scout, or any 3rd party service with project based email addresses, to bring feedback and approvals into your team's project management workflow.
